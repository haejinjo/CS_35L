First, to chheck that I am in standard C or POSIX locale, I use the command:

$ locale

I get this output:

LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_PAPER="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NAME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ALL=

Which confirms that I have yet to switch to C locale, like so:

$ export LC_ALL='C'

Make sure there are no spaces surrounding the equal sign, of it won't do the 
job. I double checked this by calling the locale command and reviewing the 
output once more: 

LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LC_CTYPE="C"
LC_NUMERIC="C"
LC_TIME="C"
LC_COLLATE="C"
LC_MONETARY="C"
LC_MESSAGES="C"
LC_PAPER="C"
LC_NAME="C"
LC_ADDRESS="C"
LC_TELEPHONE="C"
LC_MEASUREMENT="C"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="C"
LC_ALL=C

Next, to create a sorted list of English words, I sort the file stored on the 
Linux servers and redirect the file into my own words.txt in my current 
directory like so:

$ sort /usr/share/dict/words > words.txt

Then I create a text file, assign2.html, containing the HTML of the assignment 
spec's webpage:

wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring17/cs35L/assign/assign2.html

and I run the following commands with assign2.html as standard input. 

1) tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html
Anything that is not an alphabet letter (also known as the complement of 
'A-za-z'), including spaces and numbers and symbols, is replaced with a 
newline. 

2) tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html 
This command does the same thing as the previous except that it takes any of 
the non-alphabet repeated characters and squeezes them into one instance of 
that character. This way, any duplicate/excess spaces or newlines or even 
symbols (which we can more or less assume won't be appear multiple times in our 
english words, if at all), they won't disrupt the consistent, pretty list we 
have going on. 

3) cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
This command has the exact same line contents/configuration of the previous, 
except now each of the lines are sorted in lexicographical order. 

4)  cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
This outputs the same list of words except it suppresses all but one of each 
instance of a word, cutting down and making the list much more efficient to 
read. 

5) cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words
This splits the words up into 3 columns, where the left most is words unique to 
assign2.html, the middle contains words unique to words.txt, and the rightmost 
contains word entries that appear in both. 

6) cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words
This command suppresses the second and third columns of the regular comm 
output, thereby showing JUST the first column (aka the unique-to-assign2.html 
column) in sorted unique order. 

We can use line #6 as a crude implementation of an English spell checker. 

Now, how do we create a Hawaiian spell checker? (after all, we are C-SHELL 
scripting hehe)

Note: Hawaiian's traditional orthography has only the following letters (or 
their capitalized equivalents), assuming ASCII '''(which has no capitalized 
equivalent) in place of its okina symbol: 
p k ' m n w l h a e i o u 
P K   M N W L H A E I O U 

First, I retrieve a given Hawaiian/English word list site using wget command, 
which automatically saves it into the file, hwnwdseng.htm in my current 
assignment directory: 

$ wget http://mauimapp.com/moolelo/hwnwdseng.htm

In order to extract just the Hawaiian words from the HTML, I needed to develop 
a good understanding of regex as well as the commands: grep (search for and 
select), sed (search and modify patterns), and tr (one-and-done modify). 
I used these concepts to write a script, buildwords.sh, that applies an 
automated, systematic set of rules that read the HTML from standard input and 
write a sorted list of unique words to standard output. 

First to isolate the chunk of the document that actually contains the Hawaiian 
words, I check which lines the word entries begin and end, using them in a sed 
instruction: 

sed -n '30, 984p' |

Then I search and select just the lines that contain both English and Hawaiian 
vocabulary:

grep "<\(td\)>.\+</td>" |

Once I have all the words isolated, I delete every other line starting from the 
first English word:

sed '1~2d' | 

After which, I use sed again to effectively remove all angle-bracket pairs that
contain any number/type of characters other than a right angle bracket: 

sed 's/<[^>]*>//g' | 

Then I treat upper as lower case letters:

tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' |

Then, I remove all leading spaces in the list:

sed 's/    //g' |

To account for entries w/ alternate translations I replace all commas with 
single newlines:

sed 's/,/\n/g' |

And all spaces with newlines as well:

sed 's/\s/\n/g' | 

I then treat the ` (ASCII grave accent) as if it were a ' (ASCII apostrophe) 
with this command, (which took a few tries to execute because I needed to 
use double quotes instead of single, presumably because the char i'm trying to 
replace is a single quote and it could get confused):

sed "s/\`/\'/g" | 

And finally I delete any lines containing 1 or more non-Hawaiian letters to 
account for entries that are improperly formatted and might contain English:

sed "/[^pk'mnwlhaeiou]/d" |

I sort the remaining list of words, removing any duplicates: 

sort -u 

This finally allows me to execute a shell script: 

$ chmod +x buildwords

that systematically applies all the rules necessary for a Hawaiian 
mini-dictionary, given by this command: 

$ cat hwnwdseng.htm | ./buildwords > hwords

To apply the Hawaiian (rather than English) spell checker, I run the following 
shell command, noting that because I made the Hawaiian "dictionary" all lower 
case as per the specifications, I should also make the list of assignment page 
words lowercase when comparing: 

$ cat assign2.html | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | 
sort -u | comm -23 - hwords | wc -l 

The "wc -l" instruciton is added on in order to output the number of lines that 
differ between hwords and assign2.html (aka the spelling mistakes), and 
according to said output there are 405 Hawaiian spelling mistakes in the 
assignment webpage. 
To test for bugs, I run the spellchecker against the hwords dictionary itself:

$ cat hwords | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort -u | comm -23 - hwords | wc -l

and naturally get 0 spelling mistakes. 

Interestingly some words are "misspelled" in English but not when checked with 
Hawaiian, and vice versa. To see which ones were which, I stored the respective 
mistakes into englishmistakes.txt and hawaiianmistakes.txt by replacing the pipe
into wc -l with a redirection into textfiles. I ran the following shell 
commands 
on these files:

$ cat englishmistakes.txt | comm -23 - hawaiianmistakes.txt 
(to get the 3 English-but-not-Hawaiian errors: halau, lau, wiki)

$ cat englishmistakes.txt | comm -13 - hawaiianmistakes.txt 
(to get the MANY only-for-Hawaiian errors: abovementioned, system, checkers)
