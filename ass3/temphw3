1) Below is the chunk of Brady's patch file relevant to the question:

@@ -2014,7 +2014,6 @@ decode_switches (int argc, char **argv)
             break;

           case long_iso_time_style:
-          case_long_iso_time_style:
             long_time_format[0] = long_time_format[1] = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M";
             break;

I believe Brady's patch removed the line "case_long_iso_time_style:" because it was repeated twice. However, because it was part of a switch statement, it would have had the same effect without being removed, because it would have simply fallen through to the second one. It's nicer this way, though, because who wants unnecessary liens of code. 


2) If my company were to adopt this patched version of Coreutils instead of the default one, it might introduce new problems with the application for users in non-English speaking countries where they might not understand the English words and/or the ordering of the month/day/year itself.
